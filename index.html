<h1> Hello Will </h1>
Hiya Back!!
<p>
 I'm a big fan of art in the form or cartoons and/or animation. I think it's very interesting and extremely creative,
  the way artists are able to imagine the world in a way that is comically different but still realistic. Although, I am
  not much of an artist myself, I love to observe cartoons in either drawings, comics, and/or movies. They allow for a sense of
  humor and sometimes exaggeration to be applied to ordianry daily situations.
